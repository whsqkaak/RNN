# RNN
A repository for implementations of RNN based Neural Network by PyTorch.

## Introduction
This repository contains implementations of RNN based Neural Networks(RNN, LSTM, GRU) by PyTorch.

A recurrent neural network (RNN) is a class of artificial neural networks where connections between nodes form a directed or undirected graph along a temporal sequence. This allows it to exhibit temporal dynamic behavior. Derived from feedforward neural networks, RNNs can use their internal state (memory) to process variable length sequences of inputs. This makes them applicable to tasks such as unsegmented, connected handwriting recognition or speech recognition. Recurrent neural networks are theoretically Turing complete and can run arbitrary programs to process arbitrary sequences of inputs.

$$ h_{t} = tanh(W_{x} x_{t} + W_{h}h_{tâˆ’1} + b) $$
